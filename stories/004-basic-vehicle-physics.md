# Story 004: Basic Vehicle Physics

## Short Description
Implement fundamental vehicle physics including movement, rotation, and basic physical properties. Vehicles should feel responsive while maintaining realistic driving behavior.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 002: Vehicle Spawning System completed
- Godot physics system understanding

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vehicle can move forward and backward with acceleration/deceleration
2. Vehicle can turn left and right with appropriate rotation
3. Vehicle has momentum and doesn't stop instantly
4. Basic friction prevents sliding when not accelerating
5. Vehicle stays grounded on the track surface

## Visual Changes
- Motion blur effect during acceleration
- Slight tilt animation when turning (banking effect)
- Particle effects from tires when braking
- Speed lines when at maximum velocity
- Subtle squash/stretch on acceleration/deceleration
- Shadow beneath vehicle for grounding

## Definition of Done
- Physics feels responsive and fun
- Parameters are easily tunable
- No physics glitches or unstable behavior
- Performance optimized for mobile
- Cross-platform consistency

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Forward/Backward Test**: Accelerate and decelerate, verifying smooth movement
2. **Turning Test**: Turn left/right at various speeds, checking rotation behavior
3. **Momentum Test**: Release acceleration and verify gradual slowdown
4. **Friction Test**: Stop accelerating on turns and verify vehicle doesn't slide excessively
5. **Grounding Test**: Drive full lap ensuring vehicle stays on track surface

## Risks
- Physics tuning might require extensive iteration
- Different feel needed for different vehicle types
- Performance impact on mobile devices
- Unrealistic physics could break immersion
