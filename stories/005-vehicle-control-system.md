# Story 005: Vehicle Control System

## Short Description
Implement input controls for vehicles supporting keyboard, touch, and gamepad inputs. Controls should be intuitive and responsive across all input methods.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 004: Basic Vehicle Physics completed
- Understanding of Godot input system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Keyboard controls: arrow keys or WASD for movement
2. Touch controls: on-screen buttons or gestures
3. Gamepad support for console-style play
4. Controls are responsive with minimal input lag
5. Control scheme can be easily remapped

## Visual Changes
- On-screen touch controls:
  - Semi-transparent buttons with Pulse Purple (#7A4EBC) accents
  - Visual feedback on button press (scale and glow)
  - Directional arrows or virtual joystick option
- Input indicator HUD showing active controls
- Button press animations (100ms squish effect)
- Visual feedback for control remapping interface

## Definition of Done
- All input methods implemented and tested
- Controls feel intuitive and responsive
- Input mapping is configurable
- No input conflicts or dead zones
- Platform-specific optimizations applied

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Keyboard Test**: Use arrow keys and WASD to control vehicle movement
2. **Touch Control Test**: Test on-screen controls on mobile/tablet
3. **Gamepad Test**: Connect gamepad and verify all controls work
4. **Responsiveness Test**: Check for input lag across all methods
5. **Remapping Test**: Verify controls can be reassigned without issues

## Risks
- Touch controls might feel imprecise
- Input lag could affect gameplay feel
- Supporting multiple input methods increases complexity
- Platform-specific control issues
