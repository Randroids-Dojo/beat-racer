# Story 007: Vehicle Lane Switching

## Short Description
Implement smooth lane switching mechanics allowing vehicles to transition between the three lanes. Switching should feel responsive while preventing unrealistic instant teleportation.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 003: Three-Lane System Implementation completed
- Story 005: Vehicle Control System completed

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vehicle can switch to adjacent lanes with appropriate input
2. Lane switches have smooth transition animations
3. Vehicle cannot switch multiple lanes simultaneously
4. Lane switching is disabled at track boundaries
5. Clear visual feedback during lane transitions

## Visual Changes
- Lane switch animation (300ms smooth curve)
- Trail effect during lane transition
- Flash effect when entering new lane
- Arrow indicators showing available lane switches
- Color change in vehicle glow based on current lane:
  - Left lane: Teal tint (#4ECDC4)
  - Center lane: Neutral (no tint)
  - Right lane: Yellow tint (#FFD460)
- Particle burst on lane change completion

## Definition of Done
- Lane switching feels natural and responsive
- Transition timing is consistent
- No glitches or vehicle clipping
- Works smoothly on all track sections
- Input buffering prevents missed switches

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Adjacent Switch Test**: Switch from center to left/right lanes
2. **Animation Test**: Verify smooth transition animations
3. **Multi-Lane Prevention Test**: Attempt to switch multiple lanes at once
4. **Boundary Test**: Try switching at track edges
5. **Feedback Test**: Check visual indicators during transitions

## Risks
- Transition speed might feel too fast/slow
- Edge cases during simultaneous inputs
- Collision detection during lane switches
- Different feel needed for different vehicle types
