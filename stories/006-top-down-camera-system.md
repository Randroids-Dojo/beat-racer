# Story 006: Top-Down Camera System

## Short Description
Implement a top-down camera that provides a clear view of the track and follows the active vehicle. Camera should remain stable while providing good visibility of upcoming track sections.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 001: Track Environment Setup completed
- Story 002: Vehicle Spawning System completed

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Camera maintains consistent top-down perspective
2. Camera follows the active vehicle smoothly
3. Entire track width is visible at all times
4. Camera shows enough track ahead for planning moves
5. Camera rotation follows track curves naturally

## Visual Changes
- Subtle camera shake on vehicle collision
- Smooth interpolation for camera movement
- Slight zoom adjustment based on vehicle speed
- Vignette effect at screen edges for focus
- Optional grid overlay for development/debugging
- Camera position indicators for multi-vehicle scenarios

## Definition of Done
- Camera movement is smooth without jitter
- View frustum properly optimized
- Works well at different screen aspect ratios
- No motion sickness inducing movements
- Performance optimized for all platforms

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Perspective Test**: Verify camera maintains proper top-down view
2. **Following Test**: Drive vehicle and confirm smooth camera following
3. **Visibility Test**: Check full track width is visible at all positions
4. **Look-ahead Test**: Verify adequate forward visibility for gameplay
5. **Rotation Test**: Navigate curves and verify natural camera rotation

## Risks
- Camera following might feel disorienting on curves
- Different screen sizes might require camera adjustments
- Performance impact of camera calculations
- Balancing visibility with aesthetic appeal
