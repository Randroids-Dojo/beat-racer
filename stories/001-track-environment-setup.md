# Story 001: Track Environment Setup âœ… COMPLETED

## Short Description
Create the basic track environment with a simple oval or circular layout serving as the foundation for the game. The track should have clear visual distinction between lanes and provide a clean top-down view.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Godot project initialized
- Basic scene structure established

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A circular/oval track is visible from a top-down camera perspective
2. Track has three clearly defined lanes (left, center, right)
3. Lane boundaries are visually distinct
4. Track has proper start/finish line marker
5. Track dimensions accommodate vehicle movement

## Visual Changes
- New track background with appropriate theme colors (#1A1A2E for Neon Circuit theme)
- Lane dividers using white dashed lines (5px dash, 5px gap)
- Left lane with Beat Teal (#4ECDC4) accents
- Right lane with Sound Yellow (#FFD460) accents
- Center lane with Neutral Gray (#777777) color
- Start/finish line with distinct visual treatment
- Track width of 360px (120px per lane)

## Definition of Done
- Code is properly documented
- Scene files follow Godot best practices
- Builds successfully on mobile and desktop platforms
- Track assets are optimized for performance
- No visual artifacts or rendering issues

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Track Visibility Test**: Launch the game and verify the track is clearly visible from top-down view
2. **Lane Distinction Test**: Visually confirm three lanes are distinguishable with clear boundaries
3. **Lane Boundary Test**: Verify lane boundaries are consistent throughout the track
4. **Start/Finish Line Test**: Confirm start/finish line is clearly marked and positioned correctly
5. **Track Dimensions Test**: Verify track scale allows adequate space for vehicle navigation

## Risks
- Track scale might need adjustment once vehicles are implemented
- Performance considerations for mobile devices with track rendering
- Visual clarity at different screen resolutions
- Color contrast for accessibility
