# Story 008: Track Boundaries and Constraints

## Short Description
Implement track boundaries that keep vehicles within the playable area. Add invisible walls or physics constraints to prevent vehicles from leaving the track.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 001: Track Environment Setup completed
- Story 004: Basic Vehicle Physics completed

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vehicles cannot drive outside track boundaries
2. Collision with boundaries feels natural, not jarring
3. Boundaries work consistently around entire track
4. Visual indicators show track limits clearly
5. No exploit allows bypassing boundaries

## Visual Changes
- Track boundary walls with theme-appropriate styling:
  - Neon Circuit: Glowing neon barriers
  - Studio Space: Clean white rails
  - Beat Street: Concrete barriers with graffiti
  - Synth Space: Energy field effect
- Collision spark effects on boundary contact
- Warning indicators when approaching boundaries
- Subtle red flash/vignette on collision
- Debug mode showing collision boundaries

## Definition of Done
- Boundary system is reliable and consistent
- Collisions don't cause physics glitches
- Performance efficient collision detection
- Works with all vehicle types
- Thoroughly tested for edge cases

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Boundary Collision Test**: Drive into track edges and verify containment
2. **Natural Feel Test**: Check collisions don't feel jarring or break immersion
3. **Full Track Test**: Test boundaries around entire track perimeter
4. **Visual Indicator Test**: Confirm boundary indicators are clear
5. **Exploit Test**: Attempt to break through boundaries in various ways

## Risks
- Boundary collisions might feel frustrating
- Complex track shapes could have gaps
- Performance impact of collision detection
- Edge cases with vehicle physics
