# Story 002: Vehicle Spawning System

**Status: COMPLETED**

## Short Description
Implement a system to spawn vehicles at the track's starting position. Vehicles should be properly positioned in the center lane and ready for player control.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 001: Track Environment Setup completed
- Basic vehicle assets/models available

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Vehicle spawns at the designated starting position
2. Vehicle faces the correct direction along the track
3. Vehicle is positioned in the center lane by default
4. Vehicle has proper collision bounds
5. Multiple vehicle types can be spawned using the same system

## Visual Changes
- Vehicle models with type-specific color schemes:
  - Sedan: Blue with sound wave details (#7A4EBC accents)
  - Sports Car: Red with musical note accents (#E94560)
  - Van: Orange/yellow with drum patterns (#FFD460)
  - Motorcycle: Purple with waveform details (#7A4EBC)
  - Truck: Green with ambient patterns (#44C767)
- Spawn effect with particle burst matching vehicle color
- Subtle idle animation (floating/hovering)
- Collision bounds visualization for debugging

## Definition of Done
- Spawning system is modular and reusable
- Code follows SOLID principles
- Unit tests for spawning logic
- Builds successfully on all target platforms
- No memory leaks or performance issues

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Spawn Position Test**: Spawn a vehicle and verify it appears at the correct starting position
2. **Direction Test**: Confirm vehicle faces forward along the track direction
3. **Lane Position Test**: Verify vehicle spawns centered in the middle lane
4. **Collision Bounds Test**: Check vehicle collision bounds are properly sized
5. **Multi-Vehicle Test**: Spawn different vehicle types and verify all work correctly

## Risks
- Vehicle scale might not match track dimensions
- Spawn position might need adjustment for different track layouts
- Performance impact when spawning multiple vehicles
- Collision detection setup complexity
