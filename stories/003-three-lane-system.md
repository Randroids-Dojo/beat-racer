# Story 003: Three-Lane System Implementation

## Short Description
Implement the core three-lane system that defines left, center, and right lanes on the track. Create lane detection logic to determine which lane a vehicle occupies at any given time.

## Existing Implementation Expectations (Dependencies)
- Story 001: Track Environment Setup completed
- Basic understanding of track dimensions and lane positions

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Three lanes are programmatically defined with clear boundaries
2. System can accurately detect which lane a vehicle occupies
3. Lane transitions are detected when vehicle crosses boundaries
4. Lane detection works consistently around entire track
5. Lane system accounts for curves in the track

## Visual Changes
- Lane visual indicators:
  - Left lane: Beat Teal (#4ECDC4) glow/highlight
  - Center lane: Neutral Gray (#777777) subtle marking
  - Right lane: Sound Yellow (#FFD460) glow/highlight
- Lane boundary lines: White dashed (5px dash, 5px gap)
- Active lane highlighting when vehicle occupies it
- Transition effect when crossing lane boundaries
- Debug visualization showing lane detection zones

## Definition of Done
- Lane detection algorithm is efficient and accurate
- Code is well-commented and maintainable
- Unit tests for lane detection logic
- Performance profiling shows minimal overhead
- Builds and runs on all platforms

## Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Lane Definition Test**: Verify three lanes exist with proper boundaries throughout track
2. **Detection Accuracy Test**: Move vehicle to each lane and confirm correct detection
3. **Transition Detection Test**: Cross lane boundaries and verify transitions are detected
4. **Curve Handling Test**: Test lane detection accuracy on curved sections
5. **Full Track Test**: Complete a full lap verifying consistent lane detection

## Risks
- Lane detection accuracy on sharp curves
- Performance impact of continuous lane checking
- Edge cases at lane boundaries
- Handling vehicle positions between lanes during transitions
