# Story 005: Basic Track Layout - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete track system for Beat Racer with the following components:

## Components Created

### 1. TrackGeometry (`scripts/components/track/track_geometry.gd`)
- Creates an oval track with three lanes
- Features:
  - Configurable track width (default: 300px)
  - Three lanes with distinct colors
  - Oval shape with straight sections and curves
  - Lane divider lines (dashed white, solid yellow center)
  - Methods to get lane positions and detect closest lane

### 2. StartFinishLine (`scripts/components/track/start_finish_line.gd`)
- Checkered flag pattern start/finish line
- Features:
  - Visual checkered pattern (black and white stripes)
  - Lap timing functionality
  - Signal emission for lap completion
  - Collision detection for vehicles

### 3. BeatMarker (`scripts/components/track/beat_marker.gd`)
- Visual indicators for beat positions along the track
- Features:
  - 16 markers per lap (configurable)
  - Special visual for measure starts (diamonds vs circles)
  - Activation animation on beat
  - Synchronized with BeatManager

### 4. TrackBoundaries (`scripts/components/track/track_boundaries.gd`)
- Collision boundaries for track edges
- Features:
  - Inner and outer track walls
  - StaticBody2D collision detection
  - Automatic boundary generation based on track geometry

### 5. TrackSystem (`scripts/components/track/track_system.gd`)
- Main track controller that combines all components
- Features:
  - Automatic setup of all track components
  - Beat marker management
  - Lane detection utilities
  - Track progress calculation

## Test Scenes Created

1. **track_test.gd/tscn** - Full-featured test scene
2. **simple_track_test.gd/tscn** - Simplified test without dependencies
3. **track_demo.gd/tscn** - Basic visual demonstration

## Scripts Created
- `run_track_test.sh` - Launch the main track test
- `run_simple_track_test.sh` - Launch the simple track test

## Tests Created
- `test_track_system.gd` - Comprehensive unit tests
- `test_track_integration.gd` - Integration tests
- `test_track_system_simple.gd` - Simple unit tests

## Visual Design
- Dark asphalt track color (0.2, 0.2, 0.2)
- White lane divider lines with transparency
- Yellow center line
- Orange beat markers with yellow accents for measures
- Checkered start/finish line

## Technical Notes
- Uses Node2D draw functions for efficient rendering
- Implements proper collision detection with Area2D and StaticBody2D
- Follows Godot 4 best practices for scene composition
- Modular design allows for easy customization

## Usage Example
```gdscript
# Create a complete track system
var track_system = TrackSystem.new()
add_child(track_system)

# Get current lane for a position
var lane = track_system.get_current_lane(vehicle.global_position)

# Get progress along track (0.0 to 1.0)
var progress = track_system.get_track_progress_at_position(vehicle.global_position)
```

## Next Steps
- Story 006: Single Vehicle Implementation
- Story 007: Lane Detection System
- Story 008: Vehicle Control System

## Known Issues
- Class name recognition in tests requires preloading
- Some test scenes may need additional setup for full functionality

## Conclusion
Successfully implemented all requirements for Story 005:
✓ Basic oval track with three lanes
✓ Clear visual distinction between lanes
✓ Start/finish line indicator
✓ Beat markers along track
✓ Track boundaries for collision detection
✓ Test scenes to demonstrate functionality

The track system is now ready for vehicle implementation in the next story.
