# Story 011: Path Playback System - Summary

## What Was Built
A complete path playback system that replays recorded vehicle paths as ghost vehicles, creating musical loops through lane-based sound generation.

## Key Components
1. **PathPlayer** - Core playback engine with interpolation and timing control
2. **PlaybackVehicle** - Ghost vehicle that follows paths and triggers sounds
3. **PlaybackModeIndicator** - UI for playback control and status
4. **Demo Scene** - Interactive demonstration of recording and playback

## Core Features
- Smooth path interpolation (Linear, Cubic, Nearest)
- Variable playback speed (0.25x to 2.0x)
- Automatic looping with loop counter
- Beat-synchronized playback option
- Ghost vehicle with customizable appearance
- Trail effects for visual feedback
- Sound triggering during playback
- Pause/resume functionality

## Integration Success
- Seamlessly uses recordings from Story 010
- Triggers lane sounds during playback
- Maintains beat synchronization
- Creates musical loops through driving

## Technical Highlights
- Catmull-Rom spline interpolation for smooth curves
- Efficient state machine for playback control
- Comprehensive signal system for events
- Full test coverage (unit and integration)

## Result
Players can now record their driving patterns and watch ghost vehicles replay them, creating layered musical compositions through the game's core mechanic of lane-based sound generation.
