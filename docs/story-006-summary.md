# Story 006: Single Vehicle Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Story 006 successfully implements a single vehicle with rhythm-based mechanics that integrates with the existing track and beat systems.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Base Vehicle System (`vehicle.gd`)
- Top-down physics-based movement
- Configurable physics properties (speed, acceleration, turning)
- Visual representation with direction indicator
- Collision detection with track boundaries
- Signal-based status updates

### 2. Rhythm Vehicle (`rhythm_vehicle.gd`)
- Extends base vehicle with beat-synchronized mechanics
- Boost system activated by accelerating on beat
- Perfect timing detection with bonus rewards
- Visual and audio feedback for rhythm hits
- Performance tracking (accuracy, perfect beats)

### 3. Testing Coverage
- Comprehensive unit tests for vehicle physics
- Integration tests for track-vehicle interaction
- Rhythm mechanics validation
- Beat synchronization testing

### 4. Demo Scene
- Full-featured demonstration of rhythm mechanics
- Real-time performance statistics
- Visual beat feedback
- Metronome toggle for practice

## Technical Architecture

### Vehicle Physics
- Uses CharacterBody2D for smooth movement
- Drift-based physics for realistic handling
- Layer-based collision system:
  - Layer 1: Track boundaries
  - Layer 2: Vehicles
  - Layer 4: Future vehicles (multiplayer)

### Rhythm Integration
- Connects to BeatManager for timing
- Beat window detection (Â±150ms default)
- Boost power scaling based on accuracy
- Audio feedback via SoundGenerator

### Performance Tracking
```gdscript
{
    "perfect_beats": int,
    "total_beats": int,
    "accuracy": float,
    "current_boost": float,
    "boost_active": bool
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Basic Vehicle
```gdscript
var vehicle = Vehicle.new()
vehicle.max_speed = 600.0
vehicle.acceleration = 800.0
add_child(vehicle)
```

### Creating a Rhythm Vehicle
```gdscript
var rhythm_vehicle = RhythmVehicle.new()
rhythm_vehicle.boost_on_beat = true
rhythm_vehicle.boost_power = 200.0
rhythm_vehicle.beat_window = 0.15
add_child(rhythm_vehicle)
```

### Handling Beat Events
```gdscript
rhythm_vehicle.beat_hit.connect(func(beat_num, perfect):
    print("Beat %d hit! Perfect: %s" % [beat_num, perfect])
)
```

## Demo Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Vehicle movement
- **Space**: Toggle metronome
- **R**: Reset position
- **ESC**: Exit

## Performance Tips
1. Accelerate in sync with beats for speed boosts
2. Perfect timing (within 30% of beat window) gives 50% extra boost
3. Visual flash indicates beat timing quality:
   - Green: Perfect timing
   - Yellow: Good timing
   - Red: Missed beat

## Future Enhancements
1. Multiple vehicle support
2. Power-ups and special abilities
3. Lane-switching mechanics
4. Obstacle avoidance
5. Multiplayer support
6. Vehicle customization
7. Advanced physics (skidding, jumps)
