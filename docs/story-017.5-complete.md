# Story 017.5: Main Game Scene Integration

## Overview
**Story 017.5: Main Game Scene Integration**  
*Create unified gameplay experience combining all implemented systems*

This story bridges the gap between the completed core systems (Stories 001-017) and the extended functionality stories (018-020). It integrates all existing components into a cohesive main game scene that delivers the complete beat creation experience.

## Requirements

### Core Integration
- [ ] Combine vehicle driving with real-time sound generation
- [ ] Integrate lane detection with automatic sound triggering  
- [ ] Connect recording system for capturing musical patterns
- [ ] Enable playback system for looping recorded beats
- [ ] Provide sound bank selection for musical variety
- [ ] Include audio mixing controls for real-time adjustments
- [ ] Add comprehensive UI for all game functions

### Game Modes
- [ ] **Live Play Mode**: Drive and create sounds in real-time
- [ ] **Recording Mode**: Capture driving patterns as musical loops
- [ ] **Playback Mode**: Listen to recorded compositions
- [ ] **Layering Mode**: Add new parts while existing loops play
- [ ] **Mixing Mode**: Adjust audio parameters during playback

### User Interface
- [ ] Main menu with mode selection
- [ ] In-game controls for all systems
- [ ] Real-time feedback for recording/playback state
- [ ] Sound bank and preset selection
- [ ] Audio level monitoring and control

### Polish Features
- [ ] Smooth transitions between game modes
- [ ] Visual feedback for all user actions
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow
- [ ] Help/tutorial overlay for new users

## Technical Implementation

```

### Game State Management
- **GameStateManager**: Controls transitions between different play modes
- **Mode States**: Live, Recording, Playback, Layering, Mixing
- **Persistence**: Auto-save current session state
- **Input Handling**: Context-sensitive controls based on current mode

## Success Criteria

- **Functional Integration**: All previous story components work together seamlessly  
- **Complete Workflow**: Players can create, record, and play back musical compositions  
- **Intuitive Interface**: New users can understand and use the system  
- **Performance**: Stable operation during complex multi-system usage  
- **Extensibility**: System ready for additional features (Stories 018-020)  

## Impact on Future Stories

This integration story creates the foundation for:
- **Story 018: Save/Load System** - Now has complete compositions to save/load
- **Story 019: Audio Export** - Can export full integrated compositions  
- **Story 020: Track Editor** - Can test track modifications in complete environment
