# Story 015: Vehicle Feel Improvements - Summary

## What Was Implemented
Enhanced the vehicle physics and feel with smooth acceleration curves, momentum-based movement, visual banking, particle effects, and a state machine for different driving modes.

## Key Components
- **EnhancedVehicle class**: Extends base Vehicle with improved physics
- **Acceleration/deceleration curves**: Speed-dependent power delivery
- **Momentum preservation**: Natural drift and turn behavior
- **Visual banking**: Vehicles lean into turns
- **Particle effects**: Tire smoke and speed lines
- **State machine**: Idle, Accelerating, Cruising, Braking, Drifting

## Quick Test
```bash
# Run the interactive demo
./run_vehicle_feel_demo.sh

# Controls:
# - Arrow keys to drive
# - Space for handbrake
# - 1-5 for physics presets
# - Tab to toggle UI
```

## Integration
To use the enhanced vehicle in your scene:
```gdscript
var vehicle = preload("res://scripts/components/vehicle/enhanced_vehicle.gd").new()
add_child(vehicle)
```
