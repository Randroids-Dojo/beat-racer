# Story 009: Lane Position to Sound Mapping - Summary

## What Was Built

Created the **LaneAudioController** system that connects vehicle lane position to sound generation, implementing the core gameplay mechanic where driving in different lanes produces different sounds.

## Key Components

1. **LaneAudioController** - Bridges lane detection to sound generation
   - Manages lane-based audio switching
   - Handles smooth transitions between lane sounds
   - Configurable center lane silence
   - Volume management and fade effects

## Core Features

- **Automatic Sound Switching**: Sound changes based on vehicle lane
- **Center Lane Options**: Can be silent or active (configurable)
- **Smooth Transitions**: Optional fade effects between lanes
- **Real-time Response**: Immediate audio feedback to lane changes

## How It Works

1. Vehicle moves between lanes
2. LaneDetectionSystem detects position change
3. LaneAudioController receives lane change signal
4. Controller triggers appropriate sound change
5. Optional smooth transition or instant switch
6. Sound continues while vehicle stays in lane

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Core controller functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Full vehicle-to-sound flow
- **Demo Scene**: Interactive testing environment

Run demo: `./run_lane_sound_mapping_demo.sh`

## Next Steps

With lane-to-sound mapping complete, the next story could implement:
- Lap recording system to capture player patterns
- Multiple sound bank selection
- Advanced audio effects per lane
- Visual feedback for sound generation
