# Story 018: Save/Load System - Complete

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive save/load system that allows players to save their Beat Racer compositions and load them later. The system includes a composition browser, autosave functionality, and full integration with the main game.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Composition Resource Structure
- **CompositionResource**: Main resource class containing all composition data
  - Metadata: name, author, creation/modification dates, description
  - Musical data: BPM, duration, sound bank selection
  - Layer data: Array of LayerData resources
  - Audio settings: bus volumes, effect states
  - Tags for organization

- **LayerData**: Individual layer information
  - Layer name, index, and color
  - Path samples array with position/velocity/lane data
  - Recording metadata (date, lap count)
  - Volume and mute state

- **PathSample**: Individual position sample
  - Timestamp and position
  - Velocity and current lane
  - Beat alignment information
  - Measure and beat tracking

### 2. Save System Features
- **CompositionSaveSystem**: Core save/load functionality
  - Save compositions with automatic filename generation
  - Load compositions from user directory
  - Autosave with automatic cleanup (max 5 autosaves)
  - File listing with metadata extraction
  - Import/export support for sharing
  - Error handling with signal feedback

### 3. Composition Browser UI
- **CompositionBrowser**: Full-featured file browser
  - List view with composition details
  - Search functionality by name/author
  - Multiple sort options (date, name, duration, layers)
  - Context menu with right-click support
  - Detailed information panel
  - Delete confirmation dialogs
  - Visual indicators for autosaves

### 4. Main Game Integration
- **Enhanced UI Panel**: Extended with save/load controls
  - Save/Load buttons in main UI
  - Composition name display with unsaved indicator
  - Automatic layer data conversion
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+N)

- **Save Dialog**: Custom save interface
  - Name, author, and description fields
  - Pre-populated with current data
  - Validation and error handling

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- **Unit Tests**: Complete coverage of save system
  - Resource creation and manipulation
  - File operations and error cases
  - Metadata handling and validation
  - Layer operations

- **Integration Tests**: Browser and system interaction
  - Search and sort functionality
  - Signal propagation
  - Autosave cleanup
  - UI state management

- **Demo Scene**: Interactive testing environment
  - Full save/load workflow demonstration
  - Test data generation
  - Browser interaction examples

## Key Components

### Scripts Created
1. `scripts/resources/composition_resource.gd` - Main resource classes
2. `scripts/systems/composition_save_system.gd` - Save/load logic
3. `scripts/components/ui/composition_browser.gd` - Browser UI
4. `scripts/ui/main_game_ui_panel_with_save.gd` - Enhanced game UI
5. `scenes/main_game_with_save.gd` - Main game integration

### Test Files
1. `tests/gut/unit/test_composition_save_system.gd` - Unit tests
2. `tests/gut/integration/test_save_load_integration.gd` - Integration tests
3. `scenes/test/save_load_demo.gd` - Demo scene

### Features Implemented
- ✅ Composition data structure with layers
- ✅ Save file format (.beatcomp extension)
- ✅ Load functionality with validation
- ✅ Composition browser with search/sort
- ✅ Autosave with cleanup
- ✅ Main game integration
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts
- ✅ Error handling and feedback
- ✅ Complete test coverage

## Usage

### Saving a Composition
1. Create your beat pattern by recording layers
2. Press Save button or Ctrl+S
3. Enter composition name, author, and description
4. Composition is saved to user://compositions/

### Loading a Composition
1. Press Load button or Ctrl+O
2. Browse saved compositions in the browser
3. Use search/sort to find compositions
4. Double-click or press Load to load

### Autosave
- Automatically saves during gameplay
- Maintains last 5 autosaves
- Marked with [AUTO] prefix in browser

## Technical Notes

### File Storage
- Compositions stored in `user://compositions/`
- Uses Godot's Resource system for serialization
- Binary format for efficiency
- Automatic directory creation

### Performance
- Lazy loading of composition metadata
- Efficient file size estimation
- Optimized browser refresh
- Minimal memory footprint

### Future Enhancements
- Cloud save support
- Composition sharing/export
- Version compatibility handling
- Composition preview/thumbnail generation

## Run Instructions

### Demo Scene
```bash
./run_save_load_demo.sh
```

### Run Tests
```bash
# Unit tests
godot --headless --path . -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gtest=res://tests/gut/unit/test_composition_save_system.gd

# Integration tests  
godot --headless --path . -s addons/gut/gut_cmdln.gd -gtest=res://tests/gut/integration/test_save_load_integration.gd
```

## Summary
Story 018 successfully implements a complete save/load system for Beat Racer compositions. Players can now save their musical creations, organize them with metadata, and load them for continued editing or playback. The system is fully integrated with the main game and includes comprehensive testing.
