# Story 006: Single Vehicle Implementation - Complete Documentation

## Story Goal
Implement a single controllable vehicle that moves around the track with rhythm-based mechanics that enhance gameplay through beat synchronization.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Vehicle Physics System

#### Base Vehicle Class (`vehicle.gd`)
The foundation vehicle implements top-down car physics with realistic handling:

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D
class_name Vehicle

@export var max_speed := 600.0
@export var acceleration := 800.0
@export var deceleration := 1200.0
@export var turn_speed := 3.0
@export var friction := 600.0
@export var drift_factor := 0.95
```

Key features:
- Drift-based movement for realistic car feel
- Speed-dependent steering (no rotation when stationary)
- Configurable physics parameters
- Visual representation with direction indicator
- Collision detection with track boundaries

### 2. Rhythm Enhancement System

#### RhythmVehicle Class (`rhythm_vehicle.gd`)
Extends the base vehicle with beat-synchronized mechanics:

```gdscript
extends Vehicle
class_name RhythmVehicle

@export var boost_on_beat := true
@export var boost_power := 200.0
@export var beat_window := 0.15  # seconds
@export var visual_beat_response := true
@export var audio_on_beat := true
```

Rhythm mechanics:
- **Beat Detection**: Monitors player input timing relative to beats
- **Boost System**: Applies speed boost when accelerating on beat
- **Perfect Timing**: 30% of beat window grants 50% extra boost
- **Visual Feedback**: Scale pulse and color flash on beat
- **Audio Feedback**: Procedural sound generation for boost
- **Performance Tracking**: Accuracy statistics and streak counting

### 3. Integration Architecture

#### Beat Synchronization
```gdscript
func check_rhythm_input() -> void:
    if throttle_input <= 0:
        return
    
    var time_to_beat = beat_manager.get_time_until_next_beat()
    var time_since_beat = beat_manager.beat_duration - time_to_beat
    var within_window = (time_to_beat <= beat_window or 
                        time_since_beat <= beat_window)
    
    if within_window and beat_cooldown <= 0:
        var accuracy = min(time_to_beat, time_since_beat) / beat_window
        var perfect = accuracy < 0.3
        apply_beat_boost(perfect)
```

#### Track Integration
- Vehicle respects track boundaries via collision layers
- Lane detection for future lane-based mechanics
- Progress tracking around the track
- Start/finish line interaction

### 4. Visual and Audio Systems

#### Visual Feedback
- Scale pulsing on beat hits
- Color modulation for perfect timing
- Boost trail rendering
- Particle effects for boost state

#### Audio Integration
- Procedural boost sounds using SoundGenerator
- Frequency modulation for perfect timing
- Bus routing to SFX channel
- ADSR envelope for natural sound

### 5. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests (`test_rhythm_vehicle.gd`)
- Vehicle initialization
- Boost application mechanics
- Perfect timing calculations
- Statistics tracking
- Signal emission

#### Integration Tests (`test_rhythm_vehicle_integration.gd`)
- Vehicle-track interaction
- Beat marker detection
- Physics with boost
- Lane maintenance
- Visual response validation

### 6. Demo Implementation

#### Demo Scene Features
- Full rhythm vehicle showcase
- Real-time statistics display
- Beat visualization panel
- Boost power indicator
- Performance rating system

## Code Examples

### Basic Vehicle Setup
```gdscript
func create_vehicle() -> void:
    var vehicle = Vehicle.new()
    vehicle.max_speed = 600.0
    vehicle.vehicle_color = Color(0.2, 0.6, 1.0)
    add_child(vehicle)
```

### Rhythm Vehicle Setup
```gdscript
func create_rhythm_vehicle() -> void:
    var rhythm_vehicle = RhythmVehicle.new()
    
    # Configure rhythm mechanics
    rhythm_vehicle.boost_on_beat = true
    rhythm_vehicle.boost_power = 200.0
    rhythm_vehicle.beat_window = 0.15
    
    # Connect signals
    rhythm_vehicle.beat_hit.connect(_on_beat_hit)
    rhythm_vehicle.boost_applied.connect(_on_boost_applied)
    
    add_child(rhythm_vehicle)
```

### Performance Tracking
```gdscript
func _on_beat_hit(beat_number: int, perfect: bool) -> void:
    var stats = rhythm_vehicle.get_rhythm_stats()
    print("Accuracy: %.1f%%" % [stats.accuracy * 100])
    
    if perfect:
        show_perfect_feedback()
```

## Performance Metrics

### Boost Mechanics
- Normal boost: 200 units acceleration
- Perfect boost: 300 units acceleration (1.5x)
- Boost duration: 0.3 seconds
- Beat window: ±150ms from beat center
- Perfect window: ±45ms from beat center

### Collision Layers
- Layer 1: Track boundaries (walls)
- Layer 2: Vehicles
- Layer 4: Reserved for vehicle-vehicle collision

## Best Practices

### 1. Vehicle Configuration
- Start with default physics values
- Tune acceleration/deceleration for track size
- Adjust turn_speed for track complexity
- Balance drift_factor for handling feel

### 2. Rhythm Tuning
- Beat window should match game difficulty
- Visual feedback should precede audio
- Boost power should be noticeable but not overpowered
- Perfect timing should feel rewarding

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Use object pooling for boost particles
- Limit visual effects on lower-end devices
- Cache frequently accessed nodes
- Profile physics calculations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Vehicle doesn't boost on beat**
   - Check if BeatManager is running
   - Verify beat_window is appropriate
   - Ensure throttle_input > 0

2. **Erratic movement**
   - Adjust drift_factor
   - Check collision mask settings
   - Verify physics process order

3. **Poor beat detection**
   - Increase beat_window slightly
   - Add visual beat indicators
   - Check audio latency

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Lane-switching mechanics
2. Drift boost system
3. Jump mechanics
4. Vehicle customization
5. AI opponents
6. Power-up integration
7. Damage system
8. Multiplayer support

### Technical Improvements

2. Adaptive difficulty
3. Physics optimization
4. Network synchronization
5. Replay system
