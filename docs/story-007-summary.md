# Story 007: Lane Detection System - Summary

## What Was Built
A comprehensive lane detection system that tracks vehicle position within track lanes in real-time.

## Key Components
- **LaneDetectionSystem**: Core detection logic
- **RhythmVehicleWithLanes**: Vehicle with lane awareness
- **LaneVisualFeedback**: Debug visualization overlay

## Features Added
✓ Real-time lane position tracking
✓ Lane transition detection
✓ Center detection within lanes
✓ Visual debug overlay
✓ Signal-based event system
✓ Integration with existing track/vehicle systems

## Quick Test
```bash
./run_lane_detection_demo.sh
```

## Key Files
- `scripts/components/track/lane_detection_system.gd`
- `scripts/components/vehicle/rhythm_vehicle_with_lanes.gd`
- `scripts/components/visual/lane_visual_feedback.gd`
- `scenes/test/lane_detection_test.tscn`

## Next Steps
- Ready for integration with rhythm mechanics
- Can be extended with predictive detection
- Visual feedback can be enhanced for production
