# Story 010: Lap Recording System - Summary

## What Was Built

Created a **Lap Recording System** that captures vehicle movement, lane positions, and timing data during gameplay. This system records player patterns for later playback, forming the foundation of the musical loop creation mechanic.

## Key Components

1. **LapRecorder** - Core recording engine
   - Samples position at configurable rate (10-60 Hz)
   - Records lane data, velocity, rotation
   - Tracks beat alignment for rhythm sync
   - Automatic lap completion detection

2. **RecordingIndicator** - UI feedback component
   - Visual recording status
   - Duration and sample count display
   - Start/stop controls
   - Progress bar

3. **Data Resources**
   - LapRecording - Complete lap data storage
   - PositionSample - Individual position snapshots
   - Built-in interpolation for smooth playback

## Core Features

- **Configurable Sampling**: Adjustable rate for performance/quality balance
- **Comprehensive Data**: Position, lane, velocity, beat timing
- **Validation System**: Minimum time, maximum duration limits
- **Lap Detection**: Automatic completion when crossing start line
- **Multiple Recordings**: Store and manage multiple lap recordings

## How It Works

1. Player starts recording (manual or automatic)
2. System samples vehicle data at set intervals
3. Each sample captures position, lane, beat info
4. Lap completion stops recording automatically
5. Recording validated and stored for playback

## Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Core recording functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Full system with vehicle/track
- **Demo Scene**: Interactive testing environment

Run demo: `./run_lap_recording_demo.sh`

## Next Steps

With lap recording complete, Story 011 will implement:
- Path playback system for recorded data
- Ghost vehicles following recorded paths
- Sound generation from recorded lane data
- Visual distinction for playback mode
