# BEAT RACER
## Game Design Document

### GAME OVERVIEW
**Beat Racer** is an innovative music creation game where players drive vehicles around a top-down track to create musical loops. By navigating between different lanes, drivers generate beats and musical patterns that automatically repeat after completing a lap. Multiple vehicles can be added to layer different instruments, allowing players to compose complete tracks through the act of driving.

### CORE CONCEPT
In Beat Racer, the path you drive becomes the music you create. Each vehicle represents a different instrument, and the lane positioning determines when and what sounds play. After completing a lap, the car automatically follows the same path, playing back the created beat pattern, while players can add new vehicles with different instruments to build a complete song.

### GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

#### Lane-Based Sound System
- **Three-Lane System:**
  - **Center Lane:** Silent/null zone - no sound is recorded
  - **Left Lane:** Produces primary instrument sounds
  - **Right Lane:** Produces alternate sounds (lower octave or complementary sounds)
- Sounds are played and recorded continuously while in a sound-producing lane
- Switching to the center lane creates silence/rest in the beat pattern
- Each transition between lanes creates distinct rhythmic elements

#### Track & Timing Structure
- Tracks are divided into invisible time segments (16 or 32 per loop)
- Lane position is sampled at these points to determine which sounds play
- Visual beat markers along the track help players align with the musical grid
- One complete lap equals one loop of the beat pattern

#### Vehicle Types & Sounds
- **Sedan:** Bass sounds
  - Left Lane: Higher bass notes
  - Right Lane: Lower bass notes
- **Sports Car:** Lead melody
  - Left Lane: Primary melody notes
  - Right Lane: Harmony or alternate melody
- **Van:** Percussion
  - Left Lane: Kick and snare drums
  - Right Lane: Hi-hats and cymbals
- **Motorcycle:** Synthesizer effects
  - Left Lane: Short, rhythmic synth sounds
  - Right Lane: Sustained synth notes and textures
- **Truck:** Atmospheric sounds
  - Left Lane: Chord stabs
  - Right Lane: Ambient pads

#### Loop Creation Process
1. **Recording Phase:**
   - Select a vehicle (instrument)
   - Drive one complete lap, switching lanes to create sounds
   - Upon completion, the vehicle automatically starts following the same path
2. **Layering Phase:**
   - Add additional vehicles with different instruments
   - Create complementary beat patterns on new laps
   - Vehicles continue looping their patterns, building the full track
3. **Mixing Phase:**
   - Adjust volume, effects, and other parameters for each vehicle/loop
   - Mute or solo specific loops to fine-tune the composition

### VISUAL DESIGN
