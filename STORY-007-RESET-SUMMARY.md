# Story 007 Reset Summary

## What Happened

During the implementation of Story 007 (Vehicle Lane Switching), we encountered persistent "previously freed object" errors in Godot. Despite extensive debugging and multiple approaches to fix the issue, the errors continued to occur.

## Key Issue

The core problem was that objects could pass validity checks (`is_instance_valid()`) but become freed before method calls could complete, particularly during physics processing. This appears to be a timing/race condition in Godot's object lifecycle.

## What We Learned

1. Simple validity checks are not sufficient in Godot
2. Physics processing is particularly vulnerable to freed object errors
3. Multiple systems referencing the same object require careful lifecycle management
4. Defensive programming and safe reference patterns are essential

## Current State

- The main branch has been reset to the last stable commit (after Story 002)
- All debugging work has been preserved in the `debugging-story-007` branch
- The debugging analysis and test scripts are available for reference

## Next Steps

When re-attempting Story 007:

1. Start with a minimal implementation
2. Use WeakRef for all vehicle references
3. Implement centralized lifecycle management
4. Add extensive logging from the start
5. Test deletion scenarios early and often

## Branch Information

- Main branch: Reset to commit `3dad5f7` (after Story 002)
- Debugging branch: `debugging-story-007` contains all analysis and test files

To access the debugging work:
```bash
git checkout debugging-story-007
```

To continue with Story 003:
```bash
git checkout main
```

## Files to Reference

When implementing Story 007 again, refer to these files in the debugging branch:
- `stories/007-freed-object-issue-analysis.md`
- `stories/007-implementation-reset-plan.md`
- `scripts/test_freed_object_reproduction.gd`
- `scripts/vehicle_input_controller_debug.gd`

Remember: Start simple, test often, and prioritize stability over features.
